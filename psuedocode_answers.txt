1.	Why do programmers use pseudocode?
To logically breakdown the problem into steps that are understandable to humans

2.	If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
Psuedocode is an informal language that breaks down large problem into steps that the programmers use to develop the solution

Programming Assignmentâ€”Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

1.	 Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.
CALL greater WITH number1, number2
	IF number1 is greater than number2 THEN
		RETURN number1
	ELSE
		RETURN number2
	END IF

2.	Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.
INIT number to 1
CALL printNumbers WITH number
	WHILE the number is less than or equal to 100
		PRINT number
		INCREMENT number

3.	Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.
CALL searchContact WITH name RETURNING result
	FOR each entry in the contact array
		IF name is equal to the search name THEN
			RETURN result
		END IF
	RETURN contact not found
	END FOR

4.	Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

//javascript code
var contacts = [{name:'sandra', age:25}, {name:'peter', age:31}, {name:'john', age:23}, {name:'michelle', age:19}];
function searchContact(name){
	for (let i=0; i<contacts.length; i++){
		if (contacts[i].name ===name){
			return contacts[i];
		}
	}
	return 'Contact not found';
}
