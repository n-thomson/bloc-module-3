1. What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?
   You are looking for an address on a particular street.

2. What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?
   Searching for a word in dictionary.

3. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find
   the value G using linear search?
   Seven

4. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find
   the value G using binary search?
   Three

5. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search
   and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
   Sort the list and then perform binary search. Even though sorting would take some additional time,
   binary search is more efficient here, as it follows a divide and conquer policy in contrast to linear search,
   which goes item by item till the desired item or the end of the array is reached.

6. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and
   binary search? Explain your reasoning.
   Binary search; because this is a large collection, we can arrive at the answer faster by utilizing binary search
   as it follows a divide and conquer policy, where as linear search would go item by item till we reach the item we are
   looking for and this would be time consuming given the size of the current collection.

Programming Assignment:
1. You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.


function binarySearch(collection, value){
  value = value.toLowerCase();
  let low = 0
  let high = collection.length-1;
  let mid;
  let counter = 0;

  while(low<=high){
    counter++;
    mid = Math.floor((low+high)/2);
    if(value > collection[mid]){
      low = mid+1;
    }
    else if(value < collection[mid]){
      high = mid-1;
    }
    else if(value === collection[mid]){
      return `Found 'Albatross' in ${counter}th search at index ${mid}`;
    }
  }
  return "not found";
}

collection = ['a', 'aaa', 'aaaa', 'albatross', 'bakdsa', 'dfsdf', 'sdfsd', 'sdfsdf', 'sfdkdjfkl'];
newCollection = collection.sort();
value = 'Albatross';
console.log(binarySearch(newCollection, value));


2. You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.

  function linearSearch(collection, targetFish){
    let result;
    for(let i=0; i<collection.length; i++){
      if(collection[i]===targetFish){
        result = i+1;
        break
      }
    }
    return `${result}th fish is the white-spotted goldfish`;
  }


  collection = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'spotted-goldfish', 'd'];
  targetFish = 'spotted-goldfish';
  console.log(linearSearch(collection, targetFish));
